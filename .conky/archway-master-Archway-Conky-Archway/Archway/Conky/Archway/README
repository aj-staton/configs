##   Archway Conky   ##
Place this entire folder into your .conky folder.  i.e. ~/.conky/Archway
(If moved to another location and using the Archway-mpd edit the path in cover.sh)

Archway-mpd requires mpc and a last.fm API key that you put in the cover.sh file

Archway-clock should simply work

Archway-system requires 'PizzaDude Bullets' font be installed.  These are for the up/down wifi
arrows (other fonts can be substituted with some modifictaion to the script)
